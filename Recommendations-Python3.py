# The objective is to generate some movie recommendations for a user, given movies they have already
# watched, and the ratings they gave for those movies 

# We will do this a few different ways. We'll also use Pandas, a data analysis library, for most of the 
# data preparation and analysis. 

# First let's start by downloading the dataset we'll be using. This is the  MovieLens dataset
# which is maintained by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Minnesota

# There are several datasets available of varying sizes. Let's download the 100K dataset. 
# This has 100K data points, each row is a rating given by 1 user for 1 movie at a particular date and time
# Check out the readme that comes with the data to see all the files that are provided 

# There are 2 files that we are interested in u.data - this has the userId, the movieId,
# the rating and the date that rating was given 

# u.item has a bunch of movie related details, like the title, genre, imdb url etc. 
# We'll just use this file for the movie titles 

# Pandas is a python library for data analysis in a way that's similar to 
# dataframe manipulation in R. We can read the data from a csv, write to a csv, 
# manipulate it into different shapes , subset the data based on conditions etc 

dataFile='C:/Users/Ankit Godiyal/Desktop/ml-100k/u.data'
data=pd.read_csv(dataFile,sep="\t",header=None,
                 names=['userId','itemId','rating','timestamp'])


# This line will read the data file, it will treat it as a tab delimited file, 
# ie the columns (or values) are separated by \t
# There is no header in the file, (this is specified to Pandas by header=None)
# the names list will be used as the column names for the data
# the first column will be checked to see if it's a serial number, if yes 
# it will be automatically used as a row index. Else a row index which starts from 
# 0 will be assigned 



# In[2]:

# data is a pandas DataFrame object. There are many complex ways of indexing this 
# DataFrame aand manipulating it, subsetting it etc.. 
# head() will print the first few rows in the DataFrame

# Here we are reading the movie data. We just care about the itemId (movieId) and 
# the title, so we are only reading the first two columns - this is specified in 
# usecols. We are explicitly passing the column names in names. Note that index_col
# is set to false. This will explicitly make sure that none of the columns in the

# Let's get down to finding some recommendations now! 

# We'll start by using a neigbour based collaborative filtering model 
# The idea is to find the K Nearest neighbours of a user and 
# use their ratings to predict ratings of the active user for movies 
# they haven't rated. 

# First we'll represent each user as a vector - each element of the vector 
# will be their rating for 1 movie. Since there are 1600 odd movies in all 
# Each user will be represented by a vector that has 1600 odd values 
# When the user doesn't have any rating for a movie - the corresponding 
# element will be blank. NaN is a value in numpy that represents numbers that don't 
# exist. This is a little tricky - any operation of any other number with NaN will 
# give us NaN. So, we'll keep this mind as we manipulate the vectors

# pandas pivot table is very much like an excel pivot table or an SQL group by
# This will take our table which is arranged like userid, itemid, rating 
# and give us a new table in which the row index is the userId, the column idex is
# the itemId, and the value is the rating

    # returns the mean of an array after ignoring and NaN values 
    user2=np.array(user2)-np.nanmean(user2)
